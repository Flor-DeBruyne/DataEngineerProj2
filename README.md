# DEP2 - Data Engineering Project II

## Overview
(DEP2) Data Engineering Project II is a project focused on the design and implementation of a data-driven solution for the management and analysis of Voka member data. This README provides an initial overview of the project, its objectives, and how to get started.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of DEP2 include:

1. [X] **Epic 1: Data Query and Validation**:
   - Description: As a key user, I can consult Voka member data in the HoGent environment, and I can execute ad hoc queries to validate the data quality.

2. [X] **Epic 2: Adding New Data**:
   - Description: As a key user, I can add new data (in the same model), typically more recent behavioral and transactional data, and changes in master data.

3. [ ] **Epic 3: Campaign Prediction for Contacts**:
   - Description: As a key user, I want to generate a list of campaigns for an individual contact, according to the likelihood that they would participate based on past participations, visit reports, characteristics of the contact, and their company, as well as relevant information for lookalikes.

4. [ ] **Epic 4: Identifying Lookalikes and Clustering**:
   - Description: As a key user, I can have a list of lookalikes for a contact that has little transaction data. I can also create clusters of contacts based on job content, company characteristics, preferences, and expected behavior.

5. [ ] **Epic 5: Contact List Generation for Campaigns**:
   - Description: As a key user, I can generate a list of contacts for a campaign based on the likelihood of participation. I also want to ensure that contacts with low marketing pressure are prioritized over contacts with high marketing pressure.
